* ISBN-10 ‏ : ‎ 0134206339
* * ISBN-13 ‏ : ‎ 978-0134206332
  * * Author: Elaine N. Marieb; Lori A. Smith
   
  * A streamlined, workbook-style approach to the A&P lab
 
  * This full-color laboratory manual is designed for instructors who teach a two-semester anatomy & physiology lab course, but do not require the full range of laboratory exercises found in Marieb’s best-selling Human Anatomy & Physiology Lab Manuals (Cat, Fetal Pig, and Main). This lab manual is written to complement Marieb’s Anatomy & Physiology, Sixth Edition, but can be used with any two-semester text. Instructors will find 27 concise, activity-based lab exercises that explore fundamental concepts in anatomy & physiology and build students’ observational and laboratory skills. Each lab is presented with learning objectives, cogent summaries of key concepts, and meaningful activities. For instructors who want their students to experience how to use a microscope, a complete exercise on its use and care can be found in Appendix A.
 
  * The fully revised Sixth Edition provides a more active, workbook-style approach that incorporates more visual summary tables, streamlines information, and engages students with hands-on drawing and review activities. Each lab includes a list of materials needed for conducting the lab, a complete list of learning objectives at the beginning of each exercise to help students track their progress, and up-to-date terminology in accordance with Terminologia Anatomica and Terminologia Histologica. The lab manual also features a full-color, extensive Histology Atlas, integrated Review Sheets with new full-color art, and new art and photos that help bring A&P to life.
